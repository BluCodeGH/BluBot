# BluBot
V2 of Blu's Discord Bot

## Installation
Note: I will not provide hosting for BluBot, as it has not gained enough popularity. In the future this may be an option.

If you do not have Python 3.6 installed, you need to download it from [here](www.python.org/downloads/) and install it, as if it were a normal program.

Next, you need do download the bot, in the upper right click the big green button that says "Clone or download" and then click "Download ZIP".

Once you have downloaded and extracted the bot, in an admin command prompt or as sudo, cd to where you extracted the bot and run `python setup.py` and answer the questions to setup the bot. Now all you need to do to run the bot is double click on `BluBot.py`, and off you go!
